# Covid19Tracker

This interactive dashboard was generated using Angular Framework to show statistics and graphs regarding covid 19. The web app is designed to perform a daily update automatically in order to show the latest statistics. The covid 19 related data comes from COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). It has been deployed using Netlify and can be accessed under: https://wonderful-mestorf-c8e617.netlify.app/. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
